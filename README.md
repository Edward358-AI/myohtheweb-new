The deployable all-in-one bundle for Myohtheweb.

See https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-App for info on how to deploy to various services.

## Deploy from terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Edward358-AI/myohtheweb-new.git
cd myohtheweb-new
npm i
npm start
```

## Deploy to Gitpod:

First, go to https://gitpod.io, and click Try for Free. Login with the preferred method (Gitlab, Github, Bitbucket)

Then, make sure you are on your dashboard, then click "create workspace (ctrl + o)"

Copy the repository url (https://github.com/Edward358-AI/myohtheweb-new) and paste it into the top input section, and select the repository that should drop down.

Make sure you use VSCode Browser/Desktop version!! Whether you use standard or large configuration doesn't matter too much.

Wait for the codespace to boot up, and the web service should automatically start. The link is going to be in the terminal, which is the bottom portion of the screen. Click on one of the links (use ctrl/cmd + click). 

Enjoy a free instance of Myohtheweb! Note: This will not keep it running forever, and you will have to keep the codespace open in case to keep it alive.
